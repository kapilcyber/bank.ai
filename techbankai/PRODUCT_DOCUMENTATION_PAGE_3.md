## Key Differentiators

### 1. **AI-Powered Semantic Understanding**
Unlike traditional ATS systems that only match keywords, TechBank.Ai uses GPT-4 to understand context and meaning, finding qualified candidates even when exact keywords don't match.

**Example**: A candidate with "React" experience will match a job requiring "JavaScript framework" skills, even if the exact keyword isn't present in the resume.

**Competitive Advantage**: 
- 30-40% more qualified candidates discovered
- Reduced false negatives in screening
- Better understanding of transferable skills

---

### 2. **Hybrid Matching Algorithm**
Combines fast keyword matching with intelligent AI analysis, providing both speed and accuracy. Traditional scoring filters candidates quickly, then AI analyzes top candidates for deeper understanding.

**How It Works**:
1. **Phase 1**: Fast keyword-based filtering (skills, experience, keywords)
2. **Phase 2**: AI semantic analysis for top candidates
3. **Final Score**: Hybrid calculation (40% skills + 30% experience + 30% semantic)

**Competitive Advantage**:
- Speed of keyword matching
- Accuracy of AI understanding
- Cost-effective (AI only for promising candidates)

---

### 3. **Comprehensive Analytics**
Not just a matching tool - provides deep insights into talent pool composition, skills distribution, geographic spread, and recruitment trends.
