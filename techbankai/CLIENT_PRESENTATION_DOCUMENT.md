## 4. Unique Selling Points (USPs)

### 1. **AI Semantic Understanding**
Unlike keyword-only ATS systems, TechBank.Ai uses GPT-4 to understand context. A candidate with "React" will match roles asking for "JavaScript framework experience" even when the exact keyword is missing.

### 2. **Hybrid Scoring**
Combines fast keyword matching with AI analysis: traditional scoring filters first, then AI evaluates top candidates. This keeps speed high and AI costs low (~$0.01–0.05 per JD analysis).

### 3. **Multi-Channel Resume Collection**
One platform for direct uploads, Gmail, Outlook, Google Drive, and bulk imports—no more scattered spreadsheets and folders.

### 4. **Explainable Matching**
Every match includes an explanation (skill overlap, experience fit, semantic fit), so hiring decisions are transparent and defensible.

### 5. **Unified Talent Pool**
Internal employees, freelancers, applicants, and hired forces in one system—enabling internal mobility and cross-role matching.

### 6. **Production-Ready**
JWT auth, role-based access, validation, background processing, and API documentation out of the box.

## 5. How TechBank.Ai Differs from Other Platforms (e.g. Naukri)

*Five clear differentiators: we have this, they typically don’t.*

| # | We have | They typically have | Why it matters |
|---|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| **1** | **AI semantic matching** — GPT-4 understands meaning (e.g. "React" matches "JavaScript framework", "ML" matches "machine learning"). | Keyword/search-term matching. Resumes without the exact words get missed. | **30–40% more qualified candidates** found; fewer false negatives. |
| **2** | **Explainable match scores** — Every candidate gets a 0–100 score **plus** a short explanation (skill overlap, experience fit, semantic fit). | "Match" badges or simple keyword counts; rarely a clear "why." | **Transparent, defensible hiring decisions** for stakeholders. |
| **3** | **One JD → full talent pool ranked in one shot** — Upload/paste one JD; the system scores and ranks the **entire** (internal + external) talent pool and returns a sorted list. | Job-centric (post job, wait for applicants) or search-centric (you run searches and filter). No "fit this JD against everyone" in one action. | **One action replaces many manual searches**; shortlist in minutes. |
| **4** | **Unified pool: employees + freelancers + applicants in one place** — One database and one matching engine for company employees, freelancers, guest applicants, and hired forces. | Job boards focus on external applicants; internal employees and freelancers live in other tools or spreadsheets. | **Internal mobility, freelancer matching, and external hiring** from a single system. |
| **5** | **Automated multi-channel resume ingestion** — Resumes from Gmail, Outlook, Google Drive, and bulk upload are pulled in, parsed by AI, and added to the talent pool without manual copy-paste. | Candidates must apply on the platform or you manually upload; no automatic ingestion from HR inboxes. | **Every resume from email and drives** lands in one place and is searchable/matched like any other profile. |

**One-line takeaway:** Semantic AI, explainable scores, one-JD-vs-entire-pool ranking, unified internal + external talent, and auto-ingestion from email/drives—all in one platform.

## 10. Anticipated Q&A

**Q: How accurate is the AI parsing?**  
**A:** GPT-4 parsing is very accurate for well-structured resumes. We validate against a schema and fall back to regex when needed. Typical accuracy is high for standard fields (name, email, skills, experience).

**Q: What about data privacy and security?**  
**A:** We use JWT authentication, encrypted passwords, role-based access, and configurable data storage. Resumes and PII can be kept on-premise or in your preferred cloud.

**Q: How much does the AI cost per analysis?**  
**A:** Typical cost is ~$0.01–0.05 per JD analysis for ~100 candidates. We use a hybrid approach so AI is only run on promising candidates to control costs.

**Q: Can we integrate with our existing ATS?**  
**A:** Integration with external ATS is on the roadmap. Today we offer a full API and can support custom integrations.

**Q: Do you support multiple languages?**  
**A:** GPT-4 handles multiple languages. We can extend parsing and matching for non-English resumes as needed.
