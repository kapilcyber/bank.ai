## Problems We Solve

### Primary Problems

#### 1. **Time-Consuming Manual Resume Screening**
**Problem**: HR teams spend 6-8 hours per day manually reviewing resumes for a single position. With hundreds of applications, this becomes overwhelming and inefficient.

**Solution**: TechBank.Ai automatically screens and ranks candidates in minutes, reducing screening time by 90%. Recruiters receive a ranked list of best-fit candidates with detailed match scores and explanations.

**Impact**: 
- Reduce time-to-hire by 60-70%
- Process 10x more applications with the same team size
- Focus on quality conversations instead of administrative tasks

---

#### 2. **Inconsistent Candidate Evaluation**
**Problem**: Different recruiters evaluate candidates differently, leading to inconsistent hiring decisions and potential bias. Manual screening is subjective and prone to human error.

**Solution**: The platform uses standardized AI-powered scoring that evaluates all candidates consistently based on skills, experience, and semantic fit. Every candidate is assessed using the same criteria.

**Impact**:
- Objective, data-driven candidate evaluation
- Reduced unconscious bias in initial screening
- Consistent quality standards across all hires

---

#### 3. **Missing Qualified Candidates**
**Problem**: Traditional keyword-based ATS systems miss qualified candidates who use different terminology or have transferable skills. A candidate with "React" experience might be missed if the JD asks for "JavaScript framework" experience.

**Solution**: AI semantic matching understands context and meaning. A candidate with React experience will match a job requiring "JavaScript framework" skills, even if the exact keyword isn't present.

**Impact**:
- Find 30-40% more qualified candidates
- Discover hidden talent with transferable skills
- Reduce false negatives in candidate screening

---

#### 4. **Fragmented Talent Data**
**Problem**: Candidate information is scattered across emails, spreadsheets, ATS systems, and file folders. Finding a specific candidate or understanding the overall talent pool is difficult.

**Solution**: Centralized database that stores all candidate information in one place with powerful search and filtering capabilities. All resumes, profiles, and match results are accessible from a single dashboard.

**Impact**:
- Instant access to any candidate profile
- Quick talent pool searches by skills, location, experience
- Better internal mobility and talent reuse

---

#### 5. **Lack of Recruitment Insights**
**Problem**: HR teams lack visibility into their talent pool - which skills are most common, where candidates are located, what experience levels are available, and how recruitment trends are changing.

**Solution**: Comprehensive analytics dashboard with visualizations showing skills distribution, geographic spread, experience levels, role-based insights, and upload trends over time.

**Impact**:
- Data-driven recruitment strategy
- Identify skill gaps in talent pool
- Understand geographic talent distribution
- Track recruitment activity and growth

---

#### 6. **Inefficient Resume Collection**
**Problem**: Resumes arrive through multiple channels (email, job boards, referrals, direct applications) requiring manual collection and organization.

**Solution**: Multi-channel resume collection with email integrations (Gmail/Outlook), bulk upload capabilities, and automated parsing. Resumes are automatically processed and added to the talent pool.

**Impact**:
- Automated resume collection and processing
- No manual file organization needed
- Faster candidate onboarding to the system

---

#### 7. **Poor Candidate-Job Fit Assessment**
**Problem**: It's difficult to accurately assess how well a candidate matches a job requirement. Traditional systems only check for keyword presence, not actual fit.

**Solution**: Hybrid scoring system that combines:
- Skill matching (40%)
- Experience matching (30%)
- AI semantic understanding (30%)

This provides a comprehensive 0-100 match score with detailed explanations.

**Impact**:
- Accurate candidate-job fit assessment
- Understand why candidates match or don't match
- Make informed hiring decisions faster
